# My Coding Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my coding journey! In this repository, I will be documenting my progress and experiences as I learn and grow as a coder.

## Goals

My coding journey started with a passion for technology and a desire to build things. Here are my coding goals:

1. Learn the basics of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C++.
2. Master front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Explore back-end development and learn about databases, APIs, and server-side languages.
4. Work on personal coding projects to apply and reinforce my learning.
5. Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.
6. Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms for problem-solving.

## Learning Resources

Throughout my journey, I'll be using various online resources and courses to enhance my skills. Some of the resources I'm using include:

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): A great platform for learning web development and more.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): Offers interactive coding lessons and projects.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): Provides a wide range of programming courses from universities.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): A place to collaborate, learn from others, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Projects

I'll be working on different coding projects to apply what I've learned and challenge myself. Some of my projects include:

1. Personal Portfolio Website Not completed
2. Todo App using React Not completed
3. Weather App using API integration Not completed
4. Blogging Platform with Django Not completed

## Milestones

I'll be setting milestones along the way to track my progress and celebrate achievements. Some of my major milestones are:

- Completing my first coding project. Done.
- Contributing to an open-source project.
- Attending coding workshops and meetups.
- Landing my first coding internship or job.
